# A R Shiny app for calulations involving binomial sampling

In easy and intuitive way you can calculate **sample size**, **probability of detection** and **uper boundary of infection rate** that can be detected using parameters of binomial distribution. All of this packed in nice *Shiny* app, with bootstrap layout.

## Input

All the values needed for calculations are provided with slider inputs.

## Output

Output is provided with interactive plot and table with values for each of three different approaches:

- Probability of detection
- Minimal sample size estimation
- Upper boundary of infection rate
